### Requirements
#### Soft requirements
During this project each member of the group wants to accomplish the following goals:
- Better their coding ability in a good environment.
- Develop social and teamworking skills.
- Get more comfortable working with Git.
- Get better at communicating or request for help from others, especially regarding deadlines and turn-ins.

#### Hard requirements
Every member will work hard to achieve the following goals:
- An above average grade (>= 7) at the final exam.
- A report and final product that every member is satisfied with.

### Expectations
During this project, we expect our group members to respect deadlines, participate
in meetings & follow through with tasks they have been assigned. Furthermore
members must listen to the opinions and ideas of other group members,
without criticism or degrading comments and actions. Members should tell the
others beforehand about their individual plans, such as jobs, social activities
or vacations. Members should also enlighten others on their work and ideas
through good communication.

### Group roles
The following group roles represent each members role.
This indicates what kind of task each member should be assigned.
The roles represented are general and represent only a fraction of reality. The
group intends to aid each other in the tasks, and to help each other if there is
a need.
- Coordinator: Lily (Leader).
- Implementer: Freja.
- Specialist: Magnus.
- Plant: Mikkel.
- Resource investigator: Frederik.
Pair programming is one of the work structures we are applying to our project.
- 1st team: Frederik, Mikkel & Lily.
- 2nd team: Freja & Magnus.

### Management
This section describes how the group will function in terms of how we communicate
& manage conflicts (if they arise)

#### Meeting structure
At the beginning of every meeting there is a 10 minutes stand-up. On
Tuesdays there is a longer meeting with a summary of the whole weeks work
and development.
Breaks are an individual option, and every member is expected to use 6 hours individually a week.

Meetings:
- Monday: Working independently
- Tuesday: 10:00--16:00
- Wednesday: 10:00--14:00
- Thursday: 10:00--14:00
- Friday: Working independently
- Saturday: Working independently
- Sunday: Working independently

#### Communication
Immediate messages will be sent on Facebook. Virtual meetings will be held
on Discord. Documents will be shared on Git. 
Verbal communication is with tolerance and patience.

#### Decision making
Process: Pros and cons of the possible solutions and each member has 1 vote.
The decision is based on the solution with most votes.

#### Managing conflicts
Personal conflicts: A neutral party describes the problem, and in pairs every one
describes their part in the conflict and how they can contribute to the solution.
Everyone then sits together and talks the solution through with honesty.
Work problems: All sides describe their problem and their solution, and
in an open discussion with patience and active listening, the group makes a
decision together with no hard feelings afterwards.

### Documentation and tools
We plan to use git for documenting our process. Specifically we will use:
- Wiki (github): For meeting logs and program manual.
- ShareLatex: To write the report.
- Microsoft Project Professional: For schedule of Gantt diagram
